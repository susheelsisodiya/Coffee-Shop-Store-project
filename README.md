🚀 Sales Dashboard Built with Power BI

I recently developed a comprehensive Sales & Performance Dashboard using Power BI, focused on providing in-depth analysis of sales data for a coffee shop chain.

🔍 Key Insights Covered:
	•	Total sales, transaction volumes, and product quantities
	•	Breakdown of sales by product category and location
	•	Monthly sales trends and performance by store
	•	Product-level performance with drill-down features

📊 Objective:
To leverage data visualization and analytics to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, enabling more informed business decisions.

🛠 Tools Used: Power BI, Data Modeling, DAX
⏱ Time Taken: 1 Day (from concept to execution)

I am always eager to connect with professionals who share a passion for leveraging data to drive business growth. Let’s connect and exchange ideas!
